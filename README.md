- Practice codebase of myBID figma file (myBID Trial (For FE team)).
- The objective is to practice incorporation of TypeScript in React Native

LATEST WORKING BRANCH

- "feature/icon-button" branch
- "feature/icon-button" will be merged to branch

p/s: there's mistake in creating the feature branch. The working tree is messy. Refer to develop for latest working branch

MISTAKES

- new feature branch must be based on the develop branch. ( to avoid large amount of commits in one branch)
- if possible, work on just one feature at one time.
- after a feature is completed and PR is made, rebase all other on progress branch on the new base branch. (Eg: develop is base branch, and there are 3 working feature branch. If feature 1 is completed and PR is made on feature 1, rebase feature 2 & 3 to the new merged branch)
